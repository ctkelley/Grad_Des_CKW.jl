This repo has the codes for the examples in

__Complexity with Hölder Continuous Gradients__

by X. Chen, C. T. Kelley, and L. Wang

__Warning:__ The work is incomplete and the codes in the __Old_Julia__ directory are poorly documented and do not use the formulation or the algorithms from the paper.
