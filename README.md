This repo has the codes for the examples in

__Complexity with Hölder Continuous Gradients__

by X. Chen, C. T. Kelley, and L. Wang

 ## Prerequisites
You must know enough Julia to 
- install packages,
- run an IJulia notebook,
- and manage Github.

## Dependencies ##

__Use the latest version of Julia (1.12) with these codes.__

You'll need to have these packages and their dependencies.
- LaTeXStrings

__Warning:__ The work is incomplete and the codes in the __Old_Julia__ directory are poorly documented and do not use the formulation or the algorithms from the paper.
